#Fill in the blank to calculate how many sectors a given 16 GB (gigabyte) hard disk drive has.
#The given hard drive is divided into sectors of 512 bytes each. How many sectors should this drive have?
# Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence. Note: To calculate the disk size, multiply by multiples of 1024.
# In the code below, the "disk_size" of 16 GB is expressed as multiplying 16 by 1024 three times to get from bytes, to kilobytes, to megabytes, and finally to gigabytes.

#Complete the code so that the string "I'am& writing Python code!" will print to the screen.
#Remember that syntax precision is important in programming languages. A missing capital letter, spelling error, or punctuation mark can produce errors.

print("I am writing Python code!")

# Should print: I am writing Python code!
